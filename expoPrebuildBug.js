This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command and your project has a complex dependency tree or uses native modules that aren't properly configured.  It might manifest as a cryptic error message during the prebuild process or a failure to generate the necessary build artifacts. The root cause is often related to incorrect package versions, missing dependencies, or conflicts between different native module versions.
