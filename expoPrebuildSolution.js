The solution involves a systematic approach to identify the conflicting dependencies:

1. **Clean the project:**  Remove the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Check `package.json`:** Review your dependencies carefully. Look for any known issues with specific versions. Consider updating dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
3. **Use `expo diagnostics`:** Run `expo diagnostics` to identify potential project issues and compatibility conflicts.
4. **Simplify dependencies (if possible):** If possible, try to temporarily remove some non-essential native modules to isolate the problem. 
5. **Gradual update:**  If you have many updates to make, do them incrementally instead of all at once. This helps narrow down the culprit in case a conflict arises. 
6. **Examine the logs:** The error output might contain hints; examine it carefully for clues on conflicting packages or modules.
7. **Check Expo's documentation:** Look for updates or known issues with your specific Expo version and native modules.
8. **Use Expo Go:**  If possible, test your project on Expo Go. This can help isolate whether the problem stems from the project setup itself or the prebuild process.

Example of improved `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.18", 
    "react": "18.2.0", 
    "react-native": "~0.71.8", 
    // ... other dependencies with explicit version numbers
    "react-native-camera": "^4.3.1" //Example of a Native Module
  }
}
```
By using explicit versions and carefully examining your dependencies, you increase the chances of building your app successfully.
