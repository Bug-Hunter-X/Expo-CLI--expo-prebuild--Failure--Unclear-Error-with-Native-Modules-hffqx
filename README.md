# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Failure: Unclear Error with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command. The problem is characterized by an unclear error message during the prebuild process, often stemming from complexities in the project's dependency tree or issues with native modules.

## Problem Description

The `expo prebuild` command unexpectedly fails, providing little to no actionable information.  This makes debugging extremely difficult.  The project might contain perfectly functioning code, yet the prebuild process halts with an obscure error.  This typically occurs when native modules are involved or there are intricate dependency relationships.

## Solution

The solution generally involves meticulously inspecting your `package.json` and carefully reviewing the versions of your dependencies.  It also involves ensuring all native modules are correctly configured and compatible.  This often requires trial-and-error troubleshooting.

This repository provides a simplified example of such a scenario, and a potential solution is offered using Expo's debugging capabilities and dependency version management.
